# Imports Organizer
This is just a simple tool to manage all your react imports. Providing well defined structure to all your imports and making them consistent throughout the project

## Features
This extension separates and sorts all your imports in the following order

- Global imports
- Third party imports
- Outer folder imports
- Current folder imports

## Usage
Using this is pretty simple you just have to bring text focus to the file which needs to be formatted and use the following key bindings

- Windows users - ```alt + n```
- Mac users - ```option + n```

If this doesn't work then use this
- Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) and search for "Sort React Imports".
